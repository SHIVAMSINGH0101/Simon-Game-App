# Simon-Game-App
Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. I created this web game created from scratch using basics of jQuery, CSS and HTML.

The program creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails the game is over. The user have to click on all the colors generated till now and in same sequence in which they are generated to moive to next level.

[Play](https://shivamsingh0101.github.io/Simon-Game-App/), enjoy and train your memory.
Happy Coding.
